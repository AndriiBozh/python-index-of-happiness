This was made to practice pandas, streamlit, plotly.express.  
There is a .csv file with a table containing the following columns: country, happiness, gdp, generosity etc.  
I made a web page using streamlit.  
There are two drop-down select boxes, options are column names.  
A user can select and plotly.express draws graphs.
